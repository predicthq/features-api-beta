# PredictHQ Features API (beta)

The Features API provides features for ML Models across all types of demand causal factors, including unscheduled events, attended events, non-attended events, and live TV events.

It allows you to go straight to feature-importance testing and improving your models rather than having to worry about first building a data lake and then aggregating the data.

## Beta

Features API is currently in beta and features will be expanded and added to over time. The endpoint currently supports:

- PHQ Attendance features (for attendance based events)
- PHQ Rank features (for scheduled, non-attendance based events)

## Notebook

Please go through the `features-api` notebook to become familiar with the Features API.
